# 🏠 House Price Prediction using XGBoost

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques, specifically the **XGBoost Regressor**. It utilizes the **California Housing dataset** and provides a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation, offering valuable insights into housing price estimation.

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop a predictive model that estimates housing prices based on various features such as income, age, and location using the California Housing dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
